## Introduction

I forked a developer portfolio website to replace my minimal portfolio and compliment my GitHub profile page and terminal website. This is a further customized website I've been wanting to build for a while, that has the "wow" factor of my terminal website thanks to three.js 3D graphics, interactive animations, and parallax, while maintaining an easy-to-use and intuitive design. This website gives a prospective client or employer a quick look at me and my work as a developer, showing them what I can do with not just the projects listed, but the website itself. And yes, I know the parallax gets tricky when shrinking the window, but I'll fix that... one day... maybe. Maybe one of y'all can fix it for me.
